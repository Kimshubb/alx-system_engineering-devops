SAMPLE POSTMORTEM REPORT
Credits to CHATGPT-3.5 for the humourous perception of a rather unfortunate postmortem
 Issue Summary:

Duration: The great digital meltdown struck on April 3, 2024, from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM (UTC).
Impact: Our primary web application decided to take a nap, causing 30% of users to experience the dreaded spinning wheel of doom.
Root Cause: A sneaky database deadlock snuck in during rush hour, causing chaos in the data lanes.
Timeline:

10:00 AM (UTC): Monitoring alarms started screeching about slow response times.
10:05 AM: Engineers sprung into action, armed with their trusty keyboards.
10:10 AM: Initial investigations began, with logs being scrutinized for clues.
10:30 AM: The theory of network gremlins was entertained, but quickly dismissed.
11:00 AM: The database squad was called in for backup.
11:30 AM: Database deadlock identified as the culprit, locking up our precious data.
12:00 PM: The cavalry of senior engineers arrived to assess the situation.
1:00 PM: The deadlock was broken, and the database was freed from its digital chains.
2:00 PM: Service was restored, and users rejoiced as the app sprang back to life.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: The database deadlock was caused by a traffic jam of write operations on critical tables.
Resolution: The deadlock was resolved by clearing the roadblocks and allowing transactions to flow freely.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Upgrade database management system to include deadlock detection.
Implement database connection pooling to prevent future bottlenecks.
Develop automated deadlock detection and resolution scripts to keep the data flowing.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Apply patches to the database system to enhance deadlock detection and prevention.
Implement performance monitoring on critical tables to catch potential issues early.
Conduct regular load testing to ensure our systems can handle peak traffic without breaking a sweat.
In conclusion, while we can't predict when the next digital meltdown will strike, we can arm ourselves with better monitoring and proactive maintenance to keep our systems running smoothly. Let's learn from this experience and continue to improve our infrastructure to provide the best experience for our users.
